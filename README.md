## Product Description 
  **Syncra** is an independent, self-contained software product designed to serve as an online portfolio and professional networking platform,
  similar to LinkedIn and JobStreet. It aims to provide individuals with a space to showcase their skills, experience, and accomplishments,
  while also allowing recruiters and employers to search for and connect with potential candidates. The platform will integrate seamlessly
  with third-party tools (such as job application portals and social media), but it is designed as a stand-alone product.
